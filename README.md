# DIY Heat Pump Controller
This is a Heat Pump Controller based on Arduino Mega.
The Heat Pump is an inverter air conditioner with a heat plate heat exchanger instead of the internal unit.
All the electronics of the internal unit are preserved, so the air conditioner controller is not aware the heat is exchanged with water instead of air.
Main functionalities
- input from an existing thermostat
- electricity energy meter and calorimeter to calculate COP, spot and averaged
- air conditioning ambiant NTC manipulation
- relays for air conditioner and circulator pump
- logging to identify cycling and other behaviours
- LCD for main indicators
